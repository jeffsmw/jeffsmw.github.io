									<h2 class="major">Pic Out<sub>November-December 2016<sub></h2>
									<p>An application for foodies: those who like to eat and love to take pictures of what they eat. This application brings up Instagram photos near a location and allows users to view and get directions to restaurants.</p>
									<p>The project made with Ruby on Rails and postgreSQL, with a heavy emphasis on Javascript and Ajax. APIs in this project are Zomato, Instagram, and Google Maps. The project uses a scraping method to retrieve photos, and out of respect for Instagram's policies the app is not live.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Pet Finder<sub>November 2016</sub></h2>
									<p>A Web application for pet enthusiasts to share information on lost, seen, and found pets. This weekend project was in collaboration with Envisioning Labs and had 8 members, and relied heavily on Git and version control.</p>

									<p>I was responsible for creating the client and Ajax requests, however the client was not implemented as my role changed to designing the application interface according to the provided wireframes. Additionally I worked on making it mobile-friendly and also tested the application, verifying features worked as intended.</p>

									<h2 class="major">UBC IEEE Website<sub>September 2014 - August 2016</sub></h2>
									<p>My overarching goal of this project was to revive the club website, from a hacked and unmaintained site to a easy to manage site for years to come. I decided on using Squarespace, as it provided all the necessary tools to create a beautiful site which could be easily maintained and passed on.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Think Engineering Website<sub>November 2014</sub></h2>
									<p>I created a static webpage for Think Engineering, a networking event hosted by the UBC IEEE Student Branch. I used a free HTML5 template as my basis, making sure to keep the page clean and easy to used.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Solder Reflow Oven Controller<sub>February 2014</sub></h2>
									<p>In a group of 6, we created a solder reflow controller using our knowledge in circuitry and 8051 Assembly language. The controller was implemented through an Altera DE2 board, a standard off-the-shelf toaster oven, and through a solid state relay box.</p>

									<p>I worked on the software portion of this project, doing the majority of the coding. My tasks involved:
										<ul>
											<li>creating a state machine</li>
											<li>using interrupts and clock cycles to run processes in parallel</li>
											<li>implementing the LCD display and creating characters on the display</li>
											<li>error checking and revision control using Git</li>
										</ul>
